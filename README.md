# Architecture and Platform for Artificial Intelligence
# Parallel implementation of the Bellman-Ford algorithm

## Introduction
The Bellman-Ford algorithm is an important algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all the others in a weighted directed graph. With respect to other algorithms designed to handle the same problem, like the Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, it is slower but more versatile, since it is able to handle graphs with one or more negative edge weights. Moreover it will report if there is a negative weight cycle. The presence of the latter indicates that there is no cheapest path to reach a destination vertex: any path that has a point on the negative cycle can be made cheaper by one more walk around the negative cycle.

The Bellman-Ford algorithm has a variety of applications, for example
* network routing: it is used to find the shortest paths in routing tables, helping data packets navigate efficiently across networks
* GPS navigation and logistics: to compute fastest routes between locations, minimizing the cost
* path planning.

In this document parallel implementation of the Bellman-Ford algorithm using two different frame-works are reported:
* OpenMP, it is an application programming interface (API) that supports shared-memory multi-processing programming in different languages and on many platforms
* CUDA, it is a proprietary parallel computing platform and API that allows software to use certain types of graphics processing units (GPUs) for accelerated general-purpose processing

The developed parallel implementations will be analyzed in detail, along with their performance.
